Future enhancements for Sorm:
 * Junit tests. More are always better.
 * Plugins for other build systems.
 * Documentation, especially of the input XML format.
 * Testing corner cases, such as skipping the optional properties on links, or
   providing values for defaulted fields.
 * Verifying that error messages make sense when leaving out required fields.
   For example, what happens if you do not have a primary field defined for an
   object?
 * Flesh out the example project into something useful.
 * Make it possible to deal with Orm classes in a generic manner. This will
   likely require instance method versions of the static methods, with the Orm
   class wrapping a SormSession object. Then the Orm object can be passed around
   to other classes that may use multiple Orm objects to build a more useful
   object graph.
