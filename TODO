Future enhancements for Sorm:
 * Junit tests. More are always better.
 * Plugins for other build systems.
 * Documentation, especially of the input XML format.
 * Testing corner cases, such as skipping the optional properties on links, or
   providing values for defaulted fields.
 * Verifying that error messages make sense when leaving out required fields.
   For example, what happens if you do not have a primary field defined for an
   object?
 * Flesh out the example project into something useful.
 * Add the functionality of the test projects PersonLib.link() method to the
   standard codegen output. Needs to be efficient (a single call to each orm
   read method with a collection of all necessary objects of that type).
 * XSD constraints for various attributes (SQLType, LinkMode, ...)
 * Validation rules after parsing the input file, but before running code
   generation, so we get multiple friendly errors instead of a single unhelpful
   exception if something goes wrong.
 * Separate getters/setters from JDBC translators. It is likely to be very
   confusing for newcomers that the attributes of getters and setters describe
   the field getter/setter on the main class, but the body describes how to
   translate to/from JDBC getters/setters.
