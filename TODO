Future enhancements for Sorm:
 * Junit tests. More are always better.
 * Plugins for other build systems.
 * Documentation, especially of the input XML format.
 * Testing corner cases, such as objects without primary keys, skipping the
   optional properties on links, or providing values for defaulted fields.
 * Flesh out the example project into something useful.
 * Allow inheritance from existing classes
   * Fields need to be marked as to which class they come from
   * Field accessors need to be marked as override/non-override so we can
     properly generate @Override annotations
